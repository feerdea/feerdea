Welcome! Enjoy my research about the US economy and investment industry. Data and code are supported by my own, online material, and material from my Applied Economic Forecasting MBA classes at Saint Louis University. Be aware some docs will be visible, otherwise you have to download them. You as well can check and interact with the coding space. Please feel free to reach out with any doubts.
