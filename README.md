Welcome! Enjoy my research on the U.S. investment industry and the U.S. economy. Find everything under my repository "feerdea". The data and code are supported by my own efforts, online sources, and material from my Applied Economic Forecasting MBA classes at Saint Louis University. Some documents will be visible, while others will require downloading. You can also check and interact with the coding space "let's talk US economy and investments!". Please feel free to reach out to me via email or LinkedIn with any questions.
