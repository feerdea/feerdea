Welcome! Enjoy my research about the US economy and investment industry. Data and code are supported by my own hands, online sources, and material from my Applied Economic Forecasting MBA classes at Saint Louis University. Be aware some docs will be visible, otherwise you have to download them. You as well can check and interact with the coding space "let's talk US economy and investments!". Please feel free to reach out to me on my email or Linkedin with any questions.
